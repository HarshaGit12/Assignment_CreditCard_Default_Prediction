# Assignment  - Credit Card Default Prediction
### The purpose of this project is to predict the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's characteristics and payment history.
# Project Overview:
### Exploratory Analysis is done to understand how the probability of default payment vary by categories of different demographic variables like Education, Age etc.
### Accuracy score of 5 different Machine Learning classification models is checked using cross-validation and the training datatset is modeled using 3 Machine Learning models Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost
### XGBoost model gave better roc_auc_score of 0.782 and accuracy score of 0.82 than the other two models
